## Analyze PDF Files with Python, Streamlit and OpenAI Technologies
This is a time-saving artificial intelligence application for those who do not have time to review the entire PDF content, where the user can ask questions about the PDF content they upload and receive answers according to the content.

This app is a project held within the ["Yapay Zeka ile PDF Dosyalarından Otomatik Soru-Cevap Oluştur"](https://www.udemy.com/course/yapay-zeka-ile-pdf-dosyalarndan-otomatik-soru-cevap-olustur/) course in Udemy.
